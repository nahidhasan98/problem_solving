In here in Number Theory part, there is sum references but I did not actually read most of them
You can check some of the topics from here
https://cp-algorithms.com/

Also they are available in Geeks for geeks site here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mathematical-algorithms/

Although I did not read it as it is relatively new site but I heard it is good
The main strategy for you can be select a topic from the list, look at the resources or google about it, read it, solve 5-6 problem of it from lightoj and uva.

Then move to next topic
Like for 	Prime Generation, Sieve and How to Optimize & Bitwise Sieve, read about them from wikipedia, geeks for geeks and other side. Then solve from lightoj's category or uhunt.

For any topic, if you can't understand the topic or have problem getting resources or problem, ask me.
Also if anybody is just starting like 1-3 semester students, can start to learn math and number theory by doing https://projecteuler.net/
For you I won't say it as you have experience and basic understandings
the starting problems will be waste of time for you
